1. Core Modules
	A. User Management
		> Sign up / login / logout (JWT-based authentication)

		Two roles:
			> Patient
			> Doctor

		Basic profile for each:
			> Patient: name, email, phone
			> Doctor: name, specialization, clinic name, availability hours

	B. Appointment Management
		Patients can:
			> View list of available doctors
			> View doctor details (specialization, available slots)
			> Book appointment (choose date/time from available slots)
			> View their booked appointments
			> Cancel appointment

		Doctors can:
			> View their appointments
			> Approve or reject appointments
			> Set their available schedule (basic form)

	C. Admin (optional for MVP, can be manual for now)
			> Manage doctors and patients (add/remove/update)
			> View all appointments (for monitoring)

2. Backend (Flask)
	Flask app structured as:
		/auth → handles login/register/logout
		/doctors → CRUD for doctors, fetch list
		/appointments → booking, listing, canceling

	Database (PostgreSQL)
		Tables:
			> users (id, name, email, password_hash, role)
			> doctors (id, user_id, specialization, availability)
			> appointments (id, patient_id, doctor_id, date, time, status)

	JWT authentication (using flask-jwt-extended)
	Simple validation and error handling

3. Frontend (React)
	Views
		> Home Page – list of doctors
		> Doctor Details Page – show doctor info + book slot
		> Login/Register Pages
	
	Dashboard
		> For Patient → show booked appointments
		> For Doctor → show received appointments

	Appointment Form – choose date/time and confirm
	
	State Management

	Basic React Context or Redux Toolkit (optional at MVP)

	Handle auth state (logged in / logged out)

	API Integration

	Axios for API calls (token stored in localStorage)

	Basic loading and error handling
