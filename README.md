# Doctor Appointment System

A Doctor Appointment System would allow Patients to view & book appointments and Doctors to manage those appointments.

Built using Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and React for the frontend. The system currently supports basic Create and Read (CR) operations for managing patients. More features, such as authentication and additional CRUD operations, may be added in future iterations.

## Features

- Basic patient management (Create and Read operations)
- Modular backend structure using Flask and SQLAlchemy ORM
- PostgreSQL database integration
- React-based frontend (under development)

## Tech Stack

1. **Flask, Python** for backend development
2. **PostgreSQL** for the database
3. **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database interaction
4. **React** for the frontend

## Future Plans

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add Update and Delete operations for patients
- Expand features for doctors and appointments
